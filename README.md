# Snapdragon
Snapdragon is an initiative to provide simple, open source tech kits. The goal is to simplify complex tech concepts by providing a consistent way to interact and use the concepts in real-world projects. This is achieved by creating kits with simple,consistent interfaces and modules that students can easily integrate into their own build projects.
